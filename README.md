# G_TAG
##### GetDP_Thermal Analysis Generator

G_TAG is a command-line translation application designed to reduce user input in generating steady-state thermal input files for GetDP.

### GetDP
GetDP([getdp.info](http://getdp.info)) is a free, open source finite element solver capable of using mixed elements to solve de Rham complexes in one, two and three dimensions.
>"The main feature of GetDP is the closeness between the input data defining discrete problems( *ASCII data files* ) and the symbolic mathematical expressions of these problems."

G_TAG is used to compile and generate the ASCII data input(*.pro*) files mentioned above.

## Features
- Associative region property definitions:
  - reduces user input required to generate input(*.pro*) files for workable thermal finite element analyses.
  - link variables/values to region properties
- Automatically generated Partial Differential Equations(PDEs)
- Default object definitions
